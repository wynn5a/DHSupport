# DHSupport
A simple Domain code generator plugin for IntelliJ IDEA users.

## How to use
clone and build the source code.

- fill database settings (Only Oracle database supported for now) and the table name you want to generate domain code
- give a [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/) template path
- click `generate` button

## Be Careful
It is important to know this is pre-release software.

This project is created for the convenience of my own job, 
if you have some great ideas, feel free to `pull request`.

## Thanks
